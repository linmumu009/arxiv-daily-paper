Here, we present SuperWing, a comprehensive open dataset of transonic swept-wing aerodynamics comprising 4,239 parameterized wing geometries and 28,856 Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow field solutions. The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.",

In recent years, researchers have successfully trained such models for two-dimensional aerodynamic components, leading to notable progress in design optimization [3, 6-9]. However, developing a foundation model capable of predicting flow fields and aerodynamic performance for three-dimensional configurations such as wings remains a significant challenge. The primary limitation is the lack of sufficiently diverse datasets that capture flow fields across a wide range of wing geometries. Existing datasets predominantly focus on turbulent flows around a few fixed configurations [10, 11], and those that include multiple wing shapes still suffer from limited geometric diversity. We summarized existing wing flow field datasets in Table 1, where some studies employ fixed geometries while varying only the flow conditions [12-15], while others perturb a single baseline wing to generate training samples [4, 16-23]. Such approaches restrict the model's general applicability, since a foundation model is expected to operate across a wide variety of wing geometries. In our previous work [24, 25], we attempted to build datasets independent of a baseline wing, sampling shapes from",
