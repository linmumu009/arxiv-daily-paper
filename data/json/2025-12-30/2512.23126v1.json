    "text": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations that undermine the reliability and optimality of DPO and its equivalents. First, the optimized policy derived by current methods lacks invariance: It changes with respect to modeling choices such as the scalarization function (e.g., logistic function in Bradley-Terry model) or the reference policy. This may yield brittle behaviors of the learned policy as an artifact of parameterization rather than a reflection of true human preference, while an optimal policy must satisfy the invariance property. Second, we show that the derived policy of most existing methods is theoretically suboptimal because it fails to fully capitalize on the comparative information embedded in the pairwise preference data. This restricts the model's ability to \"compare and contrast\" responses, illuminating a unique opportunity for triggering intrinsic self-reflection. In this work, we propose a novel family of Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (InSPO) methods, which address these two limitations. We first derive a globally optimal policy that conditions on both the context and the alternative response under the pairwise preference data setting, which explicitly formalize the novel notion of self-reflection. Then we theoretically demonstrate that this formulation is superior to standard DPO and RLHF targets and guarantees invariance to the choice of scalarization and reference policy. Practically, InSPO operationalizes this target as a plug-and-play enhancement for DPO-family algorithms, decoupling the alignment goal from modeling constraints without requiring complex architectural changes. Crucially, our method incurs zero extra inference overhead, as the self-reflective mechanism is distilled into the policy during training and does not require generating alternative responses during deployment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that InSPO (implemented on a range of DPO-family algorithms) achieves consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that InSPO with self-reflection leads to more robust and human-aligned LLMs.",

    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned after pretraining through post-training alignment. This stage typically employs two complementary families of techniques [Kumar et al., 2025]. The first technique is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which fine-tunes the model to generate the correct response given an instruction, typically by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the target tokens. SFT effectively imparts formatting conventions, stylistic preferences, and basic task-following behaviors [Dong et al., 2023]. The second technique is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns the model by learning from human pairwise preference data [Ouyang et al., 2022]. This standard pipeline operates in two stages: first, a reward model is fitted to approximate human preferences, where the Bradley-Terry (BT) model is imposed to link the human preference probability with the reward contrast between two responses via the logistic function. Second, the LLM is fine-tuned by maximizing the learned reward with a penalty on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trainable policy and the reference one. The KL penalty is used to stabilize training and prevent overfitting, which is motivated by Proximal Policy Optimization",

Given a preference pair where one response is preferred over another for a given context, DPO associates a latent preference score with log-likelihood ratios between the trainable policy and a reference model and directly maximizes the margin that favors the preferred response under a logistic loss. This equivalent reformulation preserves the KL regularization implicit in RLHF while operating purely offline on the static preference pairs. The success of DPO has inspired a growing family of reward-free preference optimization methods that refine various aspects of the optimization objective, such as adjusting the loss curvature [Azar et al., 2024], incorporating length normalization [Meng et al., 2024], or modifying the reference formulation [Ethayarajh et al., 2024], to further improve DPO.",

First, the derived optimal policy lacks invariance to modeling choices including the scalarization function (e.g., the logistic function in the BT model) and the reference policy. Ideally, the aligned behavior of an LLM should reflect the ground-truth human preference distribution, independent of the mathematical formulation used to process those preferences. However, as we formally demonstrate, the putative \"optimal\" target in current frameworks shifts with these design choices. Consequently, methods such as DPO and RLHF often produce behavior that reflects parameterization artifacts rather than genuine human preferences.",

This invariance property is critical for modeling robustness and disentanglement from the reference. Specifically, human preferences are fundamentally ordinal. The optimal policy should reflect the underlying ranking of responses, rather than being an artifact of the specific choices of mathematical transformation, i.e.,  $\\Psi$ , used to process the preference probabilities or the reference policy, i.e.,  $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ . In addition, the choice of  $\\Psi$ , which is often selected for numerical stability or concavity rather than semantic relevance, should not dictate the final behavior of the model. If the optimal fine-tuned policy changes based on modeling choices, the alignment process may become brittle and inconsistent. Lastly, a principled optimization objective should decouple the learned preferences from the reference policy  $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ . Dependence on the reference policy implies that the \"optimal\" behavior is relative and transient, rather than converging toward a global optimal policy that maximizes human preference. However, the following proposition establishes that the existing target  $\\bar{\\pi}$  fails to satisfy this condition.",

This capacity for self-reflection, which existing fine-tuning methods lack, is a critical property for enhancing alignment. Furthermore, this mechanism renders  $\\pi^{*}$  invariant to both  $\\Psi$  and  $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ , ensuring that the policy targets the ground-truth human preference probability rather than optimization artifacts as  $\\bar{\\pi}$ . While Theorem 3.2 (iii) suggests that self-reflection yields no improvement if the preference function is separable, the separable condition is restrictive as it requires a correctly specified (link) function  $\\Psi$ . In other words, in the current framework of RLHF and DPO,  $\\bar{\\pi}$  is optimal only if the BT model (1) is correctly specified. More importantly, existing literature [Tversky and Simonson, 1993, Bordalo et al., 2013] demonstrates that human preferences are inherently non-separable and determined by the interaction between options. It is the context  $x$ , and the self-reflection by comparing  $y$  with  $y'$  that fundamentally shape the choice. Consequently, to leverage this comparative property, we aim to learn  $\\pi^{*}$  from the preference data  $\\mathcal{D}_n$ , and since our preference data are paired, we do not consider a larger categories of  $\\Pi$  beyond pairwise comparison.",

    "text": "RLHF is a fundamental technique for aligning large language models with human preferences and values [Bai et al., 2022]. The classical RLHF pipeline typically comprises three phases: supervised fine-tuning, reward model training, and policy optimization [Dong et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024, Tang et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2025, Chang and Li, 2024]. Proximal Policy Optimization [Schulman et al., 2017] is widely used in the policy optimization stage, where the policy model is trained to maximize the learned reward while staying close to the reference model through KL regularization. The RLHF framework has been successfully applied to various applications, including mitigating toxicity, ensuring safety, enhancing helpfulness, and improving model reasoning abilities [Chen et al., 2025b,a, Li et al., 2025b,a]. However, recent work has highlighted challenges across the PPO-based RLHF pipeline, from preference pattern to model training [Ahmadian et al., 2024, Xu et al., 2024b]. Additionally, RLHF can lead to biased outcomes, such as verbose outputs and length exploitation. Given the complexity and optimization challenges of online preference optimization",

DPO directly learns a policy model from preference data by expressing preferences through policy and reference model ratios, avoiding the online optimization of classical RLHF. Building on DPO, numerous variants have been proposed to address specific limitations or enhance performance. Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) introduces a theoretically grounded framework that avoids DPO's assumption of replacing pairwise preferences with pointwise rewards, using a squared loss objective instead [Azar et al., 2024]. Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) incorporates sequence likelihood as reward and trains alongside a supervised fine-tuning objective for improved calibration [Xu et al., 2024a]. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) extends preference optimization to non-paired data by modeling preferences through prospect-theoretic optimization [Ethayarajh et al., 2024]. Regularized DPO (R-DPO) adds explicit length regularization to prevent length exploitation [Park et al., 2024]. Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) proposes a reference-free reward formulation using length-normalized average log probability with a target reward margin, eliminating the need for a reference model during training [Meng et al., 2024].",

    "text": "In this work, we have revealed and addressed two critical limitations in current preference optimization frameworks: the lack of theoretical invariance to modeling choices and the suboptimality arising from treating response generation in isolation. We showed that standard methods like RLHF and DPO produce aligned policies that are often artifacts of parameterization rather than true reflections of human intent, while failing to leverage the comparative nature of preference data for optimal performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduced novel InSPO, a generic framework that unlocks the model's latent capacity for self-reflection. By deriving a globally optimal policy that conditions on both the context and the alternative response, InSPO achieves a target that is superior to existing baselines and guaranteed to be invariant to the choice of scalarization function or reference policy. Practically, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that induces dense reward shaping during training, guiding the model to avoid specific failure modes found in rejected responses. Crucially, InSPO distills this comparative reasoning into the policy itself, delivering these gains with zero extra inference overhead. Our comprehensive experiments on a range of DPO-family baselines confirm that InSPO consistently improves alignment performance across diverse benchmarks and scales effectively with model size. By decoupling the alignment goal from modeling constraints and unleashing intrinsic self-reflection, InSPO offers a more robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient path toward human-aligned AI. Future work may explore extending this self-reflective paradigm to online iterative training or conversational settings.",
