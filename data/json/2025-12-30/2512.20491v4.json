    "text": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric for assessing the core competitiveness of agents. However, existing works primarily focus on academic multi-hop search tasks with ground truth, such as BrowseComp, which often struggle to satisfy user demands for open-ended research tasks in real-world scenarios. Open-ended research not only demands robust retrieval capabilities but also challenges the agent's comprehensive skills in latent intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, multi-turn tool use, logical structuring, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end Deep Research agent model. We propose a novel Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities, aimed at reinforcing underlying capabilities in planning, information seeking, reflection, and report writing. In terms of the training paradigm, we construct a progressive path from agentic mid-training to supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Combined with a Checklist-style Judger reward design, this approach significantly improves robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, to address the lack of evaluations reflecting real-world demands in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench, a Chinese benchmark for realistic Deep Research scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that Step-DeepResearch, with only 32B parameters, achieves a high score of 61.42 on the Scale AI RESEARCHRUBRICS. In expert human evaluations on ADR-Bench, its Elo score significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals state-of-the-art proprietary services such as OpenAI DeepResearch and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that through a refined training scheme, medium-sized models can achieve expert-level Deep Research capabilities. With extremely low deployment and inference costs, Step-DeepResearch stands as the most cost-effective Deep Research agent model currently available in the industry.",

A clear division of responsibilities across capability expansion, behavior alignment, and objective optimization is established by this training design. In particular, high-quality atomic capability data are introduced during the mid-training stage, including planning and task decomposition ability, deep search and information seeking ability, reflection and verification ability, and report generation ability. In the subsequent SFT stage, these atomic capabilities are composed, while explicit constraints and alignment are imposed on instruction following, output structure, and task-specific formatting.

Unlike short-term searches focused on entity matching, the quality of Deep Research reports depends on multiple dimensions, including task decomposition, planning, tool invocation strategy, evidence selection and validation, and the final report generation. A recent approach is to transform report quality evaluation into a set of rubric-based scores, which are then used as optimization signals [27].

To enable the agent to genuinely learn how to complete deep-research tasks under real-world constraints, we place it in a multi-tool interactive environment during the reinforcement learning stage.

For cost control, we introduce a caching mechanism for high-cost web retrieval, reusing results for identical queries, and impose explicit budgets on the number of tool calls and total token consumption to ensure that training operates within a predictable resource envelope. Within this environment, each deep-research task is treated as a reinforcement learning episode. The agent first performs intent analysis and restates the user query, then produces a step-by-step plan, organizing tool invocations and information gathering around distinct subproblems. It subsequently filters, contrasts, and cross-validates evidence from multiple sources, and ultimately drafts a complete report. After the episode terminates, the Rubrics Judge evaluates the report against the predefined rubrics, producing multi-dimensional scores that are converted—via the strict reward mapping into reward signals used for policy updates.

For general-domain queries, user questions are typically open-ended and broad in scope, with no single standard answer. As a result, it is difficult to objectively characterize report quality through fully enumerated rubrics. Therefore, we employ a human comparative evaluation approach. Specifically, for each task, two reports generated by different models are presented to evaluators under blind-review conditions. Evaluators assign one of five categorical judgments—\"Left better / Right better / Both good / Both fair / Both poor\"—and score the outputs across four sub-dimensions: information completeness, content depth, requirement fitness, and readability, accompanied by a detailed written justification. Compared with absolute scoring, comparative evaluation introduces a reference anchor, effectively reducing uncertainty stemming from ambiguous quality standards in open-domain scenarios and more accurately capturing the user's subjective perception of report quality. To ensure reliability and consistency, we conducted systematic training for evaluators, standardized both the overall and sub-dimension scoring criteria, and formalized the blind-review procedures. This minimizes the influence of individual preference and enhances the confidence level of evaluation conclusions.",

At the early stage of constructing the evaluation framework, we prioritized domain segmentation for Deep Research queries, as this categorization directly informed the composition and distribution of the evaluation set. In our experience, defining too few domains results in insufficient coverage of query distributions, while defining too many domains leads to frequent overlaps, where a query may simultaneously fall into multiple domains. This complicates statistical analysis of query distribution and model performance across domains, reducing statistical meaning and informational value. Ultimately, we found that for Deep Research, defining roughly 6-12 domains was generally reasonable. It is not necessary to pursue a perfectly correct segmentation scheme; however, one guiding principle is that the final segmentation should effectively direct us to the right experts and evaluators for each domain.",

Aggregating multi-item results allows us to analyze overall model strengths and weaknesses. However, relying solely on such aggregated scoring only provides the final delivered output of the model, making it difficult to analyze specific issues and guide iteration. Therefore, we consider detailed evaluation dimensions to be necessary. Our experience suggests that each evaluation dimension should be independent, explicit, and executable. Independence means that the dimensions should be as decoupled as possible—though in practice this is difficult, and coupling often appears in some items. Our solution is to evaluate each dimension by focusing only on that dimension at the time. Explicitness means that each dimension should have clear criteria and requirements. Executability means that dimensions must be operational in practice. For example, in the case of long Deep Research reports, verifying each argument or data point is extremely labor-intensive and often unreliable when done manually.",

The model also led in Creative Writing (63.4), demonstrating that its underlying logic and knowledge structure generalize effectively to out-of-distribution tasks. Despite broad leadership, the model shows room for improvement in STEM (64.7) and Philosophy (46.1), currently trailing Gemini DeepResearch (70.7 and 53.5, respectively). Error analysis indicates these gaps stem from the inherent complexity of high-order reasoning. Future efforts will prioritize bridging these logical bottlenecks to enhance model performance across STEM and other highly technical domains.",

In scenarios that heavily rely on specialized professional reasoning, it trails slightly behind commercial Deep Research agents such as OpenAI and Gemini, a performance gap we attribute primarily to constraints in model parameter scale. By contrast, Step-DeepResearch demonstrates more consistent execution capabilities in general problem analysis, planning, and strategic inference tasks. We observe that base models without task-specific training often exhibit shallow response patterns, characterized by short, loosely connected sentences and superficial bullet points that provide limited practical value. Step-DeepResearch effectively rectifies these deficiencies through targeted training.",

We observe that several existing commercial systems rely on rigid output patterns, such as imposing a rigid academic structure across diverse tasks or introducing information that is only weakly related to the user's intent. In contrast, Step-DeepResearch dynamically adapts its presentation style to the specific attributes of the task, ensuring that the output structure remains highly relevant and purpose-driven."

This discrepancy highlights a limitation in checklist-based metrics: they prioritize information recall (i.e., whether key points exist) over structural coherence and narrative depth. Furthermore, we identified a negative correlation between analytical depth and comprehensiveness. When prompted to minimize list-based formatting and provide deeper insights, the model often terminated generation prematurely, leading to a drop in recall. To address this, we optimized our data synthesis pipeline by introducing a Synthesis-driven Drafting module. This module directs the model to transform raw tool-call trajectories into structured paragraphs with logical deduction, while strictly limiting the use of unordered lists as the primary content body. Additionally, we implemented a Pairwise LLM Judger for quality control. This filtering mechanism retains new reports only if they demonstrate superior depth and logic without compromising overall information coverage.",

Such deviations severely compromise the timeliness and relevance of the final reports.
