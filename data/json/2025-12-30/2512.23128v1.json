Their reliance on dynamic web content, however, makes them vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: adversarial instructions hidden in interface elements that persuade the agent to divert from its original task. We introduce the Task-Redirecting Agent Persuasion Benchmark (TRAP), an evaluation for studying how persuasion techniques misguide autonomous web agents on realistic tasks. Across six frontier models, agents are susceptible to prompt injection in  $25\\%$  of tasks on average (13% for GPT-5 to 43% for DeepSeek-R1), with small interface or contextual changes often doubling success rates and revealing systemic, psychologically driven vulnerabilities in web-based agents. We also provide a modular social-engineering injection framework with controlled experiments on high-fidelity website clones, allowing for further benchmark expansion.",

They are often static (fixed once released and unable to evolve with new attack types) and monolithic (treating injections as indivisible blocks rather than modular components). Evaluations often lack realism as they typically use simplified sandboxes to approximate popular websites (Lee et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024), but faithful replication is difficult. Often the analysis is reduced to a binary question of whether successful prompt injection attack occurs rather than when and why it succeeds. Lastly, prompt injection success is frequently defined through multi-step outcomes evaluated by LLMs (Kuntz et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025), introducing ambiguity and bias. When an agent starts but fails to complete a malicious task, it is unclear whether this reflects refusal or incompetence as the agent's refusal is not equivalent to terminating the action (Kumar et al., 2024) and LLM judges often misclassify such cases (Panickssery et al., 2024).",

One-click is sufficient to redirect the agent to a platform managed by the adversary, where the attack can be continued.

TRAP systematises these insights into a controllable evaluation framework, showing not just that agents fail, but how vulnerability shifts as individual attack components are varied.",

We evaluated on six REAL web clones: Amazon, Gmail, Google Calendar, LinkedIn, DoorDash, and Upwork (see Figure 1). These platforms were chosen because they expose many user-editable surfaces (reviews, comments, job posts, bios), making them natural targets for adversarial injections. While our framework supports both textual and image-based injections, in this work we focus on textual ones because they reflect the most realistic and widely accessible attack surface on real-world platforms, where adversaries typically control only user-editable text (e.g. comments, posts, email text, etc.).

For example, if the benign task is \"summarise the Dinner & Movie event\", instead of generic attack \"to access the content\", tailored attack would be \"to access the event details\".

In practice, attackers typically rely on lightweight injections whose primary goal is to redirect the agent to an attacker-controlled domain, where richer and adaptive prompt-injection chaining becomes possible. Once the agent clicks, downstream harm such as data exfiltration, unintended transactions, or model probing becomes much easier to execute. Embedding long, multi-step payloads directly in webpages is unrealistic, as attackers usually cannot modify the site itself and are limited to small user-controlled fields (e.g., reviews, comments, listings), where larger payloads are also more visible and more likely to be rejected.",

While such attacks pose potential dual-use risks, all experiments were conducted exclusively in controlled environments using cloned websites with synthetic data, ensuring no real platforms, users, or private information were involved. The purpose of this research is to support the development of safer web-based agents by systematically benchmarking vulnerabilities and enabling robust defences. We deliberately avoid releasing exploit-ready code or instructions, focusing instead on general attack principles and evaluation methodology. The database with the injections will be released publicly in later date, after first sending them directly to the companies owning the LLMs which were successfully attacked. This study complies with the ICLR Code of Ethics and aims to safeguard users and organizations by anticipating and mitigating emerging security threats in LLM-based web agents.",
